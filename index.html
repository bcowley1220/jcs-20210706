              At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer and the
              young shall not know where lieth the things possessed by their
              fathers that their fathers put there only just the night before,
              about eight o'clock. That's what being a Protestant's all about.
              That's why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for
              anyone who respects the individual and the individual's right to
              decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his protest
              up to the church door in fifteen-seventeen, he may not have
              realised the full significance of what he was doing, but four
              hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear whatever I
              want on my John Thomas...

              Well, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness, we
              are not, in fact, the rescue committee. However, I have been asked
              to read the following prepare statement on behalf of the movement.
              "We the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, end
              brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly
              greetings to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom."
              This morning, shortly after 11:00, comedy struck this little house
              on Dibley Road. Sudden, violent comedy.

              In 1945, peace broke out. It was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare
              was banned at a special session of the Geneva Convention, and in
              1950 the last remaining copy of the joke was laid to rest here in
              the Berkshire countryside, never to be told again. Why is it the
              world never remembered the name of Johann Gambolputty de von
